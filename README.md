# Crossword results

The [New York Times Daily Mini Crossword](http://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/mini) is more fun when you compete against your friends.

Since no social elements are built in, this application allows groups of people to track their times, compare scores, and trash talk.  
The data might help you determine what time of the day you perform best, which types of puzzles you are best at (long or short average times), and find other trends that could be helpful.
