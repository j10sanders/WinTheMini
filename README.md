# Crossword results

The [New York Times Daily Mini Crossword](http://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/mini) is more fun when you compete against your friends.

Since no social elements are built in, this application allows groups of people to track their times, compare scores, and trash talk.  

In the future, the data will be useful for determining what times of the day you perform best, if your rank depends on the average puzzle completion time, etc... 

Currently, I've limited invites so that everyone in the group knows each other -- competing against strangers isn't very fun.  In the future, I'll implement group functionality, so that anyone can join (and request to join different groups).
