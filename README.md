# Win the Mini: A Social Network for the NYT Daily Mini Crossword Puzzle

The [New York Times (Daily) Mini Crossword Puzzle](http://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/mini) is more fun when you compete against your friends.

Since no social elements are built in, this application allows friends to compare times and track their performance statistics.  Importantly, users can unfollow people who they don't care to know about.

In the future, the data will be useful for determining what times of the day you perform best, if your rank depends on the average puzzle completion time, etc... 
For now, feel free to join, invite your friends, or contribute to the project!

This project uses a Postgres db, SQLAlchemy ORM, Flask, Bootstrap, and Jinja2.
