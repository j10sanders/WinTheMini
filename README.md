# Crossword results

The NYT's daily Mini crossword is more fun when you compete against your friends: http://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/mini
Since no social elements are built in, this application allows groups of people to track their times, compare scores, and trash talk.  
The data might help you determine what time of the day you perform best, which types of puzzles you are best at (long or short average times), and find other trends that could be helpful.
